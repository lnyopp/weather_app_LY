jQuery, AJAX, Node Project
Using everything that you've learned over the past several weeks, build a single page application with the following requirements:

Have an input where a user can submit a ZIP code
Return the current time in that city (inclusive of timezone) using the Moment package
Return the current weather forecast in that ZIP using the OpenWeather API
Be creative in your website design!



Along with using jquery, ajax, and node - I learned how to use broswerify, which is still a work in progress - from my understanding - browserify allows all of your node modules/scripts to be read from one place. 

To start this application: type: npm run watch into your command line, and then open up the index.html in your browser.
